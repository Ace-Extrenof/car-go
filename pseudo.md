# things that it should do:

- [x] create orders(input from user)
- [ ] transport orders from one location to another(use time)
- [x] take order names
- [ ] make dashboard, look at order data, and their completion(like a loading bar)

## Implementation
The UI is a dashboard, allows you to do all kinda stuff. Look at Orders, see their metadata, their completion time etc. 

Its like a simulation, your cargo company is tasked with many orders and you have to send orders to the right destination. Like a game.
